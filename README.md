# Restaurant Reviews Application

## Udacity Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews Application** project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application by making the following changes:

  * Convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays.
  * Add accessibility for screen reader use.
  * Add a service worker to to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.

## Run the Application

1. From the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

  * Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  * Python 3.x: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

2. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Notes

This project utilized starter project code provided by Udacity at [https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).  The starter project code consisted of HTML, CSS styling, and javascript files to generate site content.
